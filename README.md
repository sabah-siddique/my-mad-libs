Mad Libs

The Mad Libs application emulates the popular phrasal template word game in a web format. The user chooses a story and enters words or numbers based on the specified criteria, and a story is displayed to them using their input substituted for blanks in the original story.

Components of this application:
.html - user interface with a <form> to store user input
.css - for styling
.js - collects user input from the .html <form>, inserts it into a hard-coded story template, and displays it on a new .html page
